Project Objectives
- To clean and preprocess
the dataset by handling
missing and inconsistent
values.
- To engineer new features
that could improve the
model's performance.
- To train and evaluate
machine learning models
on both the original and
enhanced datasets.
- To compare model results
and determine which
feature set performed
better.
- To generate visual insights
that explain model
performance and data
relationships.

Summary of Approach and Results
- The dataset was cleaned
by filling missing numeric
values with the mean, and
text values with the most
common entry.
- Additional features were
created to enhance model
performance.
- Two models were trained
and compared, one on the
original dataset and
another o n the new feature-
enhanced dataset.
- The second model with
new features showed an
improved R2 score and
better evaluation metrics.
- Visualizations were created
to show trends, feature
importance, and model
comparison results.
- The overall improvement
confirmed that the added
features increased
accuracy and predictive
strength.

Instructions on How to Run the Code
- Download or clone the
repository from GitHub.
- Open the project folder in
Jupyter Notebook.
- Make sure the required
libraries in the
requirements. txt file are
installed.
- Open the notebook file
inside the notebooks folder.
- Run each cell in order to
carry out the data
preprocessing, feature
engineering, model training,
and evaluation.
- The final report and results
can be viewed inside the
reports folder.
